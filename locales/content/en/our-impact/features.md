<strong>Friland accommodations are designed to have minimal environmental impact while ensuring a comfortable experience.</strong><br />
Each structure is offgrid, meaning it does not require a connection to the water and sewage network. Electricity is primarily generated by solar panels, while the water system is based on internal tanks. The interiors are finished with wood and recycled materials for thermal insulation and can be used in any season.

To promote a conscious and frugal use of resources, we have installed <strong>Quantum</strong> in our accommodations, a small monitor that provides real-time information on water and electricity consumption since the beginning of the stay.
We want to make our guests aware of their consumption and help them, if they wish, to make more sustainable choices.
