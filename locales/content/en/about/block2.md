Friland accommodations are designed to have a minimal impact on the environment without sacrificing comfort. 

They are equipped with a comfortable bed, a perfectly equipped kitchen and a minimal but comfortable bathroom. 

The rooms have IoT technology: we constantly receive data on water consumption and energy production from photovoltaic panels to guarantee an optimal experience for guests, optimizing available resources.
