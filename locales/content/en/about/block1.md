Friland was created to promote a new and responsible contact with the territory through a unique opportunity: living in ymbiosis with nature. With Friland we want to promote a temporary lifestyle. Our project embodies the idea of reversibility and allows people an authentic immersion into nature, offering an alternative to land consumption. The land is not a human 'right' , but a privilege to be respected.
